# Pathing Plus



An informational Slay the Spire 2 mod.

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build .\PathingPlus.csproj
dotnet test .\PathingPlus.Tests\PathingPlus.Tests.csproj
```

`Sts2PathDiscovery.props` finds the game through the Steam registry keys. If it cannot,
copy `Directory.Build.props.example` to `Directory.Build.props` and set `Sts2Path`.

Building copies `PathingPlus.json`, `PathingPlus.dll`, and `PathingPlus.pdb` into
`<game>/mods/PathingPlus/`. Pass `-p:SkipModInstall=true` to build without installing.
Close the game first, or the DLL will be locked.

Runtime diagnostics are in `%APPDATA%\SlayTheSpire2\logs\godot.log`. A successful start
logs `Pathing Plus v0.1.0 initialized`.

## Publish to the Steam Workshop

```powershell
.\scripts\package-workshop.ps1
```

That stages `workshop/content/` and prints the `ModUploader.exe upload -w …` command to
run next. Get the uploader from
<https://github.com/megacrit/sts2-mod-uploader/releases>.

`workshop/mod_id.txt` appears after the first upload. **Commit it** — it is the only link
between this repository and the published Workshop item.

See `docs/sts2-modding.md` for the full pipeline and `workshop/README.md` for the
`workshop.json` field reference.
